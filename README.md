# Fantasy Basketball Decision Support Tool 🏀📊  
*A full analytics + decision support system for Yahoo Fantasy Basketball*

This project builds a complete fantasy basketball optimization engine using:
- **Python**
- **Streamlit UI**
- **Custom projection engine**
- **Win probability modeling**
- **Add/Drop streaming optimization**
- **Yahoo Fantasy API (OAuth2)**

It is designed for a **Yahoo points league** and helps answer:
- “What is my projected final score this week?”
- “Which players should I stream today, tomorrow, or the next day?”
- “What is my win probability vs my opponent?”
- “How do add/drops change my chance to win?”
- “Which teams offer the best schedule for streaming?”
The add drop evaluation is essential since the league structure limits adds to 75 per season and 5 per week.

### **Streaming Optimization Engine**

- Identify optimal streaming **days**  
- Recommend **teams** to pull streamers from  
- Recommend **which players to drop** (Avg FP < 28 rule)
